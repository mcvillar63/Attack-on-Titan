    <p>
        Attack on Titan is set in a world where humanity is forced to live in cities
        surrounded by three enormous walls that protect them from gigantic man-eating humanoids
        referred to as Titans; the story follows Eren Yeager, who vows to exterminate the Titans
        after they bring about the destruction of his hometown and the death of his mother.

        The story of Attack on Titan centers on a civilization inside three circular walls.
        According to the knowledge propagated locally, it is the last surviving vestige of
        human civilization. Its inhabitants, known as Eldians, have been led to believe that
        over one hundred years ago, humanity was driven to the brink of extinction after the
        emergence of humanoid giants called Titans, who attack and eat humans on sight. The last
        remnants of humanity retreated behind three concentric walls and enjoyed roughly a century
        of peace.

    <p>
        To combat Titans, the country's military employs Vertical Maneuvering Equipment (VME), also
        called Omni-Directional Maneuvering Gear (ODM Gear): a set of waist-mounted grappling hooks
        and gas-powered propulsion enabling immense mobility in three dimensions. Swords made of
        ultrahard steel are used in conjunction with the gear, and eventually rocket launcher-like
        weapons called Thunder Spears are also developed.

    <p> “On that day, mankind received a grim reminder. <br>
        We lived in fear of the titans, and were disgraced to live <br>
        in these cages we called walls.” ― Eren Jaeger
